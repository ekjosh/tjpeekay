        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Eekay, or known more commonly as <strong>Wages Of Sin</strong>. I am presently a product designer with some experience under the belt. I am seeking to understand the fundamentals of web development, especially front end, to help me better relate with developers. And, I mean, who knows what comes after the end?
            <br>
            I am interested in all things ranging from philosophy and psychology, to my adoration and adulation for jazz, classical, opera, indie, and soul music, amongst other things that reflect my eclectic taste.
